        <h2 class="text-secondary">Loan Default Project</h2>
        <p> Financial loan servicing is a profitable business for many financial institutions. Traditionally, these companies make money on loans through administrative fees and the yield spread between
            the rates from the larger banks they borrow from and the rates they charge borrowers. However, there’s risk associated with this business.
            When people default on these loans, the lender is left on the hook. At best, the lender can go after the person’s wages. However, this can
            be a lengthy process and will delay repayment. Ultimately, the lender's goal is to lend to as many people as possible, but only to people who
            aren’t likely to default. This is where my machine learning project comes in.The project’s goal is to help identify which potential borrowers
            should be given a loan. The key objective of this
            project was to create a machine learning algorithm that estimates the likelihood of an individual defaulting or not defaulting on a loan and then use
            this probability and other financial information to calculate the expected profit from the loan. If the expected profit is positive, then the
            loan will be approved. Otherwise, it will be denied. <br><br>
            From a technical perspective, this project allowed me to hone my python skills by working in Jupyter Notebook on the Machine Learning algorithm
            itself. Along with this, it allowed me to build on my front end development skills by learning Flask, HTML, and Pycharm and creating a
            user-interface for the loan default project on my personal website. I go into more detail about the project in my github repository (link below).
